# OlympicSearch
This was a project for CSC 110. The two main class files are olympics.py and olympicsbinary.py.
olympics.py searches for a specific place that the olympics were held during a year. It uses an extremly simple searching algorithm of moving up the document until it either finds the correct year or doesn't and throws back an error string.
olympicsbinary.py is the same as olympics.py except it uses a binary search method to cut back on the nubmer of comparisons needed.
Olympics.txt is the text file the two programs use to get their data for the search. It has the year followed by a TAB space and then the location.
